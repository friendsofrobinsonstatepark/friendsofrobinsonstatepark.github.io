            # About the Friends
            
            The Friends of Robinson State Park were formed  in 2006 to express widespread opposition to a
            state-sponsored timber sale proposed for the  hardwood sections of the park. The possibility  of a timber
            sale ignited a renewed citizen focus  on the abundantly diverse forest that is  Robinson State Park and on
            the many reasons it  should be preserved in its natural state.

            Two years of study and a review of studies conducted  by a citizens’ committee in the 1980s established the
            many features of Robinson State Park that deserved recognition,  appreciation and protection.

            Over 50 native tree species have been identified in the park by  experts. More species are being found as
            studies continue. Experts  have located and measured a pignut hickory that is the largest in  the state. A
            rare community of Tulip Poplar trees is thriving in the  park. The variable terrain, the proximity to the
            Westfield River and  the multiple streams running through the park contribute to the  exceptional variety of
            species of trees. Due to the many tree types  in this rare forest, it is expected that corresponding rare
            and  endangered plants and animals common to their shared environment will  continue to be found.

            The Allen Bird Club of Springfield has recorded 186 species of birds  observed in the park over the past 50
            years. Seven vernal pools have been  certified and several more potentially certifiable pools are being
            studied.  A study by Natural Heritage over several months in 2007 has recorded 8 species  of rare
            dragonflies and damselflies, many Eastern Box Turtles and several  other rare plants and communities. It is
            notable that the Natural Heritage  database did not contain all of the species now known to exist in
            Robinson  State Park before this study was conducted.

            ISA certified arborist Matthew “Twig” Largess conducted several studies of the  park and through his
            dedication was instrumental in the ultimate decision by the state to cancel the timber sale plans and
            preserve the forest in its intact state. He was the main sponsor of the June 2007 Bio-Blitz which brought
            about 40 scientists to the park. Matt has led multiple informative walks in the park and inspired the
            Friends Group to learn about and share the importance of the park. He can be reached at largesstree@aol.com
            or by phone: (401) 423-0508.

            The Park is known to have Native American sites that were identified for preservation by the 1989 report on
            the park. The citizens’ committee that studied the park at that time stated that many areas of the park
            should be environmentally protected zones. The 1989 report and the studies of 2006-2007 indicated that the
            park was not an appropriate place for commercial timber extraction.

            Experts who have visited the park from other parts of the country are astounded by it, saying they would
            have never expected to find this kind of forest in such excellent condition in Massachusetts, particularly
            near a large city.

            Although the timber sale plans were canceled in December 2007, everyone agreed that some “hazard trees”
            should be removed to assure the safety of visitors to the park. Stressed red pines near the front entrance
            and the headquarters have been removed. When possible, however, some dead or dying trees have been retained
            for the habitat they provide, particularly for woodpeckers.

            Now, the Friends have a mission to share what has been learned about the park with the surrounding
            communities, encourage the use of the park as an “outdoor classroom” and work to make the preservation of
            the park permanent. The Agawam City Council has honored the park by unanimously approving a proclamation
            that the third Saturday of June will be Robinson State Park Day in Agawam, forever.
