      p.
       It was 10 years ago, in January 2006, that citizens who loved Robinson Stat Park first saw paint on the trees and 
       found out the state had a commercial timber sale planned in the park. A bond developed among the many people who were 
       opposed to the timber sale, appreciated the park and wanted to keep it  in its natural state. That connection among diverse 
       supporters of the park  developed into what is now the Friends of Robinson State Park.  Mike Lydick, a free lance writer for the 
       Agawam Advertiser News, wrote an engaging story of what is now the 10th anniversary of the Friends Group.  We provide the link 
       to the story here http://www.turley.com/agawamadvertisernews/aan-archives/aan01.28.16.pdfh2

        This is a picture of the “island” in front of the park headquarters where 
        distressed and dying red pines had to be removed because they posed a threat 
        to the building and to anyone nearby.  This is our “before picture”  All you 
        see here are the remaining unsightly stumps and the lonesome but healthy white pine.

        This is a photo of Matt Largess who brought his own stump grinder up from Rhode Island 
        and ground out all the stumps!

        Matt has his back to the camera. A  group of volunteers from the Friends Group
        and park employees helped to plant the trees.  Then DCR Commissioner Richard Sullivan 
        stopped by to lend his support.

        This is the final finished project. Three trees are back to the left of the headquarters building.  
        Three are on the island.  The white pine had been left on the island, and we planted the five trees 
        Matt donated   It is the only place we know of where one can see the state trees of all 6 New England 
        states in one place. If you visit the area now, you will see how the trees have grown since their planting.

      h2 Runners show character in the park
      small Original story via <a href="http://wwlp.com/2014/03/22/two-high-school-students-named-hometown-heroes/">22 News</a>.

        AGAWAM, Mass. (WWLP) – Pioneer Valley Red Cross Hometown Heroes are chosen for
        having saved lives and helped improve the lives of others, while displaying
        strength of character. 22News shows you how two Agawam High School students
        sacrificed winning a race, when they helped someone on the opposing team who
        had suffered a seizure during the race.

        “He had suffered a seizure, he was flushed, he was sweating, it didn’t look
        good,” said Sandra Land.

        Hometown Heroes Sandra Land and Gina Lopez knew that by stopping to help the
        fallen cross country athlete from Belchertown High School, Agawam High School
        would forfeit the track meet at Robinson State Park last fall. They did the
        right thing.

        “Gina going and getting help leading the people back to where I was with him,
        It seems that we lost the race in the end in the moment the face doesn’t 
        matter,” said Land.

        “I learned that anyone can rise to the occasion. You don’t have to be a doctor, 
        you can check someone in the smallest way, by checking to see If they’re okay,”
        said Lopez.

        Gina Lopez and Sandra Land made a decision that endeared them to Agawam Mayor
        Richard Cohen who nominated them as Hometown Heroes and to their proud coaches 
        Bill Dillon and Carla Warner.

        “Oh extremely, these two girls really stepped up at the right time, they did 
        the right thing,” said Coach Dillon.

        “In giving up her potential win against Belchertown, she gave back to a young 
        man’s health and the integrity of her team,” said Carla Warner.
