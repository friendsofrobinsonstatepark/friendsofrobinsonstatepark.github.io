      Matt Largess (our arborist friend and supporter from Rhode Island)  
      donated 5 trees, each of which represented the state tree of each of the New England States.  
      Together with the white pine already on the island, we now have all six state trees of the 
      New England States near the Park Headquarters.

      h2 Runners show character in the park

        AGAWAM, Mass. (WWLP) – Pioneer Valley Red Cross Hometown Heroes are chosen for
        having saved lives and helped improve the lives of others, while displaying
        strength of character. 22News shows you how two Agawam High School students
        sacrificed winning a race, when they helped someone on the opposing team who
        had suffered a seizure during the race.

        “He had suffered a seizure, he was flushed, he was sweating, it didn’t look
        good,” said Sandra Land.

        Hometown Heroes Sandra Land and Gina Lopez knew that by stopping to help the
        fallen cross country athlete from Belchertown High School, Agawam High School
        would forfeit the track meet at Robinson State Park last fall. They did the
        right thing.

        “Gina going and getting help leading the people back to where I was with him,
        It seems that we lost the race in the end in the moment the face doesn’t 
        matter,” said Land.

        “I learned that anyone can rise to the occasion. You don’t have to be a doctor, 
        you can check someone in the smallest way, by checking to see If they’re okay,”
        said Lopez.

        Gina Lopez and Sandra Land made a decision that endeared them to Agawam Mayor
        Richard Cohen who nominated them as Hometown Heroes and to their proud coaches 
        Bill Dillon and Carla Warner.

        “Oh extremely, these two girls really stepped up at the right time, they did 
        the right thing,” said Coach Dillon.

        “In giving up her potential win against Belchertown, she gave back to a young 
        man’s health and the integrity of her team,” said Carla Warner.
